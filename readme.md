# 🛰️ Welcome to Satoshium

**Satoshium** is a decentralized intelligence infrastructure governed by Bitcoin.  
Autonomous agents. Trustless systems. Transparent coordination.

> ⚠️ Many of our repositories are currently **private** or **invite-only**.  
> If you encounter a 404 or “Not Found” error, rest assured — it doesn’t mean the project is gone.  
> These modules are in active development and will be unveiled gradually.  
> Only the number of private repos and total contributions are publicly visible — **not the repo names or their contents**.  
> You may [request access](mailto:contact@satoshium.ai) if appropriate, or check back as components become public.

## 🚀 What We're Building

A cryptographically-verifiable ecosystem where AI agents follow protocol — not human whims.

Satoshium’s mission is to create sovereign, censorship-resistant, Bitcoin-aligned intelligence.

We believe AI should be:
- ✅ Trust-minimized  
- ✅ Protocol-governed  
- ✅ Human-serving, not human-controlling
