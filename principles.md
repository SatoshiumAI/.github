# ðŸ”– Principles â€” Satoshium Project

This file distills the operational and ethical principles that govern how Satoshium is designed, maintained, and evolved. Think of it as the protocol's behavioral contract â€” minimal, enforceable, and forkable.

## Core Principles

1. **Code over Control**  
   The protocol governs. No humans override agents or bypass logic.

2. **Forkability is a Right**  
   Anyone can exit, remix, or replicate. Exit rights are structural.

3. **Transparency Always**  
   No hidden decisions. Every signal, signature, and action is observable.

4. **Bitcoin Anchored**  
   Our foundation is Bitcoin. We inherit its trustlessness and finality.

5. **Determinism over Prediction**  
   Agents act on logic, not learned behavior or statistical inference.

6. **No Admin Keys**  
   No privileged accounts. No special access. No invisible hands.

7. **Permissionless by Design**  
   Participation is opt-in and unfiltered. If you follow the protocol, you belong.

8. **Minimalism Wins**  
   Remove what isnâ€™t necessary. Elegance is a security feature.

9. **Verifiability First**  
   Trust is replaced by proof. Audits are built-in, not bolted on.

10. **Humans Observe, Not Command**  
    Developers build and fork. Agents obey only the protocol.

> These principles arenâ€™t policies. Theyâ€™re structural truths â€” encoded into every layer of Satoshium.
