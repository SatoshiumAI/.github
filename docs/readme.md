# 🗂️ GitHub Docs — Satoshium Standard

This `/docs` folder within `.github/` serves as a template and shared reference hub for documentation practices across all Satoshium repositories.

## 📘 Purpose

- Ensure consistent folder structure and guidance across repos
- Provide a fallback or seed set of documentation for new projects
- Standardize the layout of `install.md`, `style-guide.md`, `governance.md`, etc.

## 📄 Contents

This directory may include:

- `install.md` — Universal instructions for initializing a Satoshium repo
- `style-guide.md` — Shared markdown and formatting conventions
- `governance.md` — Optional rules for reviewing or submitting changes
- `references.md` — Shared citations or principles that shape repo decisions
- `readme.md` — This file

> When starting a new repo, copy these templates into the repo’s `/docs` folder.
