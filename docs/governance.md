# 🧭 Governance Overview

Satoshium follows a decentralized, transparent, and open governance model aligned with its mission: **AI governed by protocol, not politics.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the principles, structure, and participation pathways in the governance of the Satoshium project. It serves as both a reference and a living document that evolves with community contributions and agent-based audit cycles.

---

## 🏛️ Governance Principles

1. **Decentralization First** – No single entity controls the project direction.
2. **Transparency** – All decisions, proposals, and changes are logged, auditable, and public.
3. **Protocol over Preference** – Agents follow protocol; humans follow process.
4. **Reproducibility** – All decisions must be documented with enough clarity to be reproducible by another party.
5. **Agent Oversight** – Specialized internal agents assist with audits, metrics, and policy enforcement.

2. **Discussion** – Community discussion period of minimum 7 days.
3. **Draft** – Pull request with a markdown file placed in `/proposals/`.

## 🔁 Change Management

All modifications to key governance, architecture, or protocol documents must:

- Be proposed via PR
- Undergo internal agent review
- Be CODEX-auditable
- Include a rationale, risk assessment, and metadata

---

## 🤖 Agent Involvement

Governance-related internal agents include:

- `policy-watcher`
- `codex-reviewer`
- `log-indexer`
- `proposal-validator`
- `metadata-inspector`

---

## 🔒 Voting Logic (Future)

A tokenless, weighted-reputation system may be introduced in future versions, based on:

- Contribution volume
- CODEX compliance history
- Proposal acceptance rate
- Agent review alignment

---

## 🧠 Evolution Path

Governance in Satoshium is not static—it is intended to evolve:

- Quarterly snapshots of decision logs
- Proposal retrospectives and reversal logic
- Simulation of governance experiments via `satoshium-simulations`
