# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### ❓ What is Satoshium?
Satoshium is a decentralized intelligence protocol where autonomous agents follow cryptographic rules instead of human commands. Anchored in Bitcoin, it aims to create a trustless framework for AI.

### ❓ Why does Satoshium exist?
Because we believe AI should be governed by logic, not influence. Our mission is to create autonomous honesty—agents that follow protocol, not politics.

### ❓ What stage is the project currently in?
We’re in Phase 1: laying the groundwork with core specs, architecture, style guides, and documentation. Most repos are private during this buildout phase.

### ❓ How can I contribute?
We’re not accepting public contributions just yet. Stay tuned via our [GitHub](https://github.com/satoshiumai), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/SatoshiumAI/), or [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/SatoshiumAI) accounts for updates.

### ❓ Is there a roadmap?
Yes. Our full project roadmap is under construction and will be linked once public. For now, development status is visible through structured commits and markdown files in each repo.

### ❓ What license does Satoshium use?
All code is licensed under the MIT License.

### ❓ Will Satoshium ever become a company?
No. Satoshium is a protocol, not a product. We’re committed to keeping it open-source, decentralized, and non-corporate.

### ❓ Is this a crypto project?
Satoshium is not a token or coin. It uses Bitcoin as a foundational truth layer for computation, not for speculation.
