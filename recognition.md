# ðŸŒŸ Satoshium â€” Recognition

While Satoshium is a protocol, not a platform or product, it exists thanks to the minds, time, and effort of individuals who believe in building differently.

This page acknowledges early contributors, collaborators, and supporters in a way that respects both anonymity and impact.
