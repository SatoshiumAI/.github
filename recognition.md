# 🌟 Recognition

> "In decentralized systems, recognition isn’t requested — it's earned."

The **Satoshium Project** exists thanks to the quiet brilliance and dedication of many. Some are known. Most choose to remain anonymous. And yet, the integrity of their contributions resonates through every line of code, every protocol we publish, and every agent we bring to life.

## 🎖️ Core Contributors

This section is intentionally left unfilled. Why?

Because in the spirit of Bitcoin and decentralization, **true impact is not measured in names — but in what endures.**

We acknowledge the following *types* of contributors:

- 🧠 **Protocol Designers** — who help define immutable logic.
- 🛠️ **Builders** — who shape tools, agents, and ecosystems from raw code.
- 🧪 **Testers** — who stress, verify, and question everything.
- 🔐 **Security Advocates** — who warn, guide, and patch in silence.
- 📚 **Writers & Documentarians** — who clarify vision and guide others forward.
- 🌀 **Early Visionaries** — whose early support helped the impossible seem inevitable.

## 🫡 Community Contributions

> You don’t need permission to make Satoshium better. Just a commit — and conviction.

If you’ve ever:
- Spotted a typo,
- Added a test,
- Suggested a protocol refinement,
- Or contributed a new way of thinking,

Then this recognition includes you. Welcome to the forge.

## 🧬 Satoshium Ethos

Recognition is not hierarchy. It’s history.

When Satoshium becomes what it must — you’ll know you helped build it.
