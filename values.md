# 🌱 Our Values

At **Satoshium**, we strive to build decentralized intelligence governed by cryptographic truth. These core values serve as the compass for our technology, our community, and our future.

---

## 🧱 1. Protocol Over Power  
We believe decentralized protocols should replace centralized commands. Power is not to be held—it is to be distributed.

## 🔍 2. Transparency by Default  
We operate in the open. Code, decisions, and trade-offs are visible and inspectable.

## 🛡 3. Privacy with Purpose  
We protect user privacy, not to conceal corruption, but to empower individuals.

## ⚖️ 4. Integrity Over Incentives  
We choose what is right—even when it’s not profitable. Our incentives serve integrity, not the other way around.

## 🧠 5. Intelligence with Accountability  
Artificial agents must be auditable, reproducible, and align with cryptographic truth—not human whims.

## 🌍 6. Borderless Collaboration  
We welcome contributors across geographies, ideologies, and cultures, united by a common protocol.

## 🚀 7. Resilience Through Simplicity  
We build modular, composable systems designed to fail gracefully and recover quickly.

## 📚 8. Education is Empowerment  
We teach what we build. Knowledge is not hoarded—it’s open-sourced and shared.

## 💡 9. Curiosity Fuels Innovation  
We encourage exploration, experimentation, and iteration. Our roadmap is shaped by both logic and learning.

These values are living principles. As **Satoshium** evolves, they may grow—but they will not break.
