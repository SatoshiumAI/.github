# Code of Conduct

Welcome to Satoshium — a decentralized intelligence protocol governed by Bitcoin.

This project exists to build trustless systems, not to control people. But respect is the foundation of every open system, and we expect all contributors to act in good faith.

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

- **Respect Autonomy:** We value sovereign thought and decentralized voices. Engage respectfully — even when you disagree.
- **Assume Integrity:** Challenge ideas, not identities. We assume contributors act in good faith unless proven otherwise.
- **No Gatekeeping:** We do not tolerate exclusion based on race, gender, religion, politics, or ideology. Merit matters. Openness matters more.
- **Stay on Mission:** Keep conversations focused on building systems that embody transparency, cryptographic truth, and decentralization.

## 🛠️ Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks or harassment
- Threats, doxxing, or intimidation
- Malicious code, exploits, or attempts to deceive the community
- Spam, trolling, or persistent off-topic disruption

## 🛡️ Enforcement

Violations may result in warnings, PR rejections, or removal from community spaces. Enforcement is at the discretion of maintainers, always in the spirit of openness and fairness.

## 🤝 Final Note

Satoshium is not owned. It is not controlled.  
It is a movement — and movements thrive through mutual respect, shared values, and sovereign minds.

Let’s build something incorruptible — together.
