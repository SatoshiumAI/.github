## ü™û Purpose of This Repository

This `.github` repository does not contain runtime code, smart agents, or decentralized logic. Instead, it serves as the central source for community standards, shared contribution guidelines, security practices, and support documentation across all Satoshium projects.

Think of it as the protocol's **governance anchor** for:

* CONTRIBUTING.md
* SECURITY.md
* SUPPORT.md
* FUNDING.yml

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Foresight

While this repo itself doesn‚Äôt implement functional architecture, it plays a foundational role in shaping it across the network of Satoshium repositories.

We may consider evolving this metadata layer to include:

* Project-wide dependency maps or coordination graphs
* Architecture indexes linking to per-repo specs
* Automated tooling to lint governance consistency across repos

| Idea                     | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `architecture-index.yml` | A future file listing each repo‚Äôs high-level components and links to their `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Cross-repo linter        | Tool that checks for consistent LICENSE, FUNDING, and SUPPORT structures                     |
| Community sync layer     | Markdown manifest for syncing core values, mission, and security posture                     |

## üöß Status

This file exists as a signal: even in meta-repos, architecture matters.

The .github directory governs how the protocol thinks about itself.
