# 🤝 Satoshium — Community

Satoshium is a decentralized protocol, not a platform or company — but there is still a community of builders, thinkers, and explorers behind it.

This page shares how you can engage respectfully, thoughtfully, and productively.

## 🧬 Our Community Is:

- **Curious** — We ask questions before offering opinions
- **Skeptical** — We challenge assumptions with reason, not outrage
- **Respectful** — We don’t tolerate coercion, spam, or hostility
- **Forkable** — We believe disagreement should lead to options, not fights

---

## 🛠️ How to Participate

Whether you're here to contribute code, start discussions, or explore ideas:

- Browse the repos and documentation
- Open a thoughtful issue
- Fork and build independently
- Share insight via respectful pull requests

---

## 💬 Where We Communicate (Tentative)

We may occasionally engage on:

- X (Twitter): [@SatoshiumAI](https://twitter.com/satoshiumAI)
- Future forums or message relays (TBD)

We do not currently run a Discord or Telegram.  
Discussion will prioritize **signal over volume**.
