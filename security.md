# 🛡️ Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any potential security issues in **Satoshium** — a decentralized intelligence infrastructure governed by Bitcoin.

This `SECURITY.md` applies to all repositories under the Satoshium organization and is managed centrally via the `.github` repo.

## 🔒 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability or cryptographic weakness:

2. Instead, please email us directly at:
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Repository and file/function (if applicable)
   - Steps to reproduce or demonstrate the issue
   - Potential impact and any known mitigations

We will respond **within 72 hours** and work with you to resolve the issue quickly and transparently.

## 📜 Disclosure Policy

Satoshium follows a responsible disclosure process:

- We investigate all reported issues promptly
- Contributors are kept informed of resolution progress
- Public disclosure will occur **after a fix is available**, unless agreed otherwise
- You may be credited in our changelog or `SECURITY.md` Hall of Thanks (with consent)

## ✅ Scope

This security policy covers:

- Code vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors, injection vectors)
- Protocol design flaws or attack surfaces
- Cryptographic misuse or unsafe defaults
- Build, packaging, or dependency weaknesses
- Exposure of private keys or unintended access patterns

Out of scope:
- UI bugs without security impact
- DoS attacks that require overwhelming infrastructure beyond expected norms
- Speculative issues without a proof of concept

## 🛡️ Our Commitment

We aim to build **verifiable**, **permissionless**, and **incorruptible** infrastructure.

Security is not a checklist — it’s a principle. We welcome all help that makes Satoshium more resilient.

## 🙏 Hall of Thanks

We gratefully acknowledge the efforts of researchers, developers, and ethical hackers who help secure our infrastructure.
