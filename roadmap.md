# 🚀 Satoshium: Public Roadmap

Welcome to the **Satoshium Public Roadmap** — a high-level glimpse into the evolution of our decentralized intelligence ecosystem. This roadmap is meant for **public visibility only** and does **not** reflect internal governance votes or private development branches.

> ⚠️ **Important**: If you are viewing this in a public repository, know that this roadmap may intentionally exclude certain experimental or strategic features. For the full vision, internal contributors should refer to protected planning channels.

## 📅 2025–2026 Roadmap Overview

### ✅ **Phase 1 – Infrastructure Foundation**  
*Status: Complete (January – June 2025)*

- 🌐 Launched foundational repositories (core, UI, agents, interface)
- 📚 Established protocol docs, governance files, and contributor standards
- 🔐 Completed CODEX audit for all core and auxiliary repositories
- 🧠 Finalized internal agent architecture (`system-maintainer`, `audit-helper`, `template-builder`, `doc-writer`)
- 📦 Created first backup snapshot (C:/satoshium/bu2025-06-28)

---

### 🛠️ **Phase 2 – Utility & Modularity**  
*Status: In Progress (June – October 2025)*

- 🧩 Develop reusable utility modules: encryption, messaging, simulation
- 🧪 Introduce consistent testing frameworks across repos
- 📁 Formalize scenario-based testing under `satoshium-scenarios`
- 🧭 Deploy internal operational agents (e.g., `repo-ops-agent`)
- 💾 Expand structured `/docs` and `/specs` across repos
- 🔐 Begin public-facing GitHub `.github` polish (this file is part of that!)

---

### 🌐 **Phase 3 – Simulation & Certification**  
*Status: Planned (November – December 2025)*

- 🧬 Launch multi-agent simulations within `satoshium-simulations`
- ✅ Create certification standards via `satoshium-certifier`
- 🧠 Test agent reasoning, coordination, and mission compliance

---

### 🌎 **Phase 4 – Network Readiness & Engagement**  
*Status: Forecasted (2026)*

- 🔗 Connect decentralized agents to live endpoints and data streams
- 🌱 Recruit aligned contributors, reviewers, and node operators
- 📢 Introduce public demos, developer documentation, and launch threads
- 🧭 Begin long-term testing of real-world use cases (health, governance, rights archival)
