# 🗺️ Satoshium — Public Roadmap (High-Level Overview)

Welcome to the **Satoshium** project roadmap.

This document outlines general phases and goals for the Satoshium protocol. It is intentionally high-level and subject to change as development progresses. For internal or granular milestones, please refer to individual repository roadmaps (private until public launch).

---

## 🌱 Phase 1 — Foundation (Complete or In Progress)

- Design and document protocol vision
- Launch initial GitHub organization structure
- Define agent-core logic and messaging schema
- Build basic node + mesh simulation environment
- Deploy internal documentation and test framework

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Infrastructure Integration (Planned)

- Modular agent runtime with plug-and-play logic
- Secure peer-to-peer communication framework (P2P mesh, Nostr)
- Optional integration: Bitcoin anchors, IPFS storage
- Multi-repo CI testing and interdependency verification

---

## 🧪 Phase 3 — Ecosystem Testing (Upcoming)

- Launch public testnet (simulated agents + relay)
- Showcase agent behavior in sandbox environments
- Community calls for contributors and reviewers
- Track edge cases, governance test proposals

---

## 🌍 Phase 4 — Public Participation (Future)

- Publish governance model and contribution guides
- Open-source launch of all key components
- Launch satoshium.ai with explorable visual UI
- Expand documentation, learning tools, and values-based outreach

---

## 🧩 Long-Term Exploration

- Extend agent support to physical hardware
- Advanced logic for multi-agent environments
- Integration with identity oracles (optional)
- Education-first tools for non-technical participants
- Multi-language tooling and interface support

> Satoshium is a work in progress — shaped by code, not hype.
>  
> Stay tuned. Fork freely. Build with reason.
