# 🧭 Governance — Satoshium Project

This document outlines the current approach to decision-making, contributions, and evolution of the Satoshium protocol and its supporting repositories.

While Satoshium is designed to minimize human discretion in runtime execution, human governance still plays a role in development, coordination, and community direction — especially in early stages.

## 🔐 Governance Philosophy

- **Minimize trust, maximize clarity**
- **Protocol behavior is not subject to votes**
- **Coordination ≠ control**

---

## ⚙️ Current Governance Model

Until decentralized coordination is embedded fully into agent governance, we use the following interim structure:

| Role           | Scope                                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Maintainers    | Merge PRs, update documentation, structure repos    |
| Contributors   | Propose improvements, fix issues, extend components |
| Observers      | Watch, fork, replicate independently                |

All contributions are expected to align with the [VALUES.md](./VALUES.md) and [PRINCIPLES.md](./PRINCIPLES.md) of the protocol.

## 🔁 Decision-Making

Decisions are made with these constraints:

- Design changes must respect agent autonomy and protocol neutrality
- No feature can introduce privileged access or override logic
- Disagreements are resolved through forking — not enforcement

---

## 🛡️ Protocol Changes

Changes to core logic (agents, relays, policies) require:

1. Clear problem definition
2. Proposed logic that maintains determinism and verifiability
3. Transparent discussion via GitHub issues or discussion threads
4. Review by maintainers
5. Optional simulation or test fork

---

## 🧪 Future Governance Vision

As Satoshium matures:

- Agents may participate in protocol-level signaling or consensus
- Mesh-based quorum or voting may govern policy updates
- Reputation-weighted relays or signaling may emerge

But for now, **governance is open-source, discussion-based, and fork-friendly**.

> Authority fades. Logic remains. That’s the path to protocol governance.
