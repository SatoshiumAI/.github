# ðŸ“˜ Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key concepts and standardized terminology used throughout the **Satoshium** ecosystem. Each entry below is foundational to understanding the structure, logic, and mission of the decentralized intelligence infrastructure we are building.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Terms

### **Agent**
A modular, autonomous unit of logic designed to carry out protocol-governed tasks in the Satoshium ecosystem.

### **CODEX**
An evolving internal specification and audit standard that ensures consistency, security, and compliance across all repositories.

### **Glyph**
A symbolic unit used to represent logic, purpose, or governance within the Satoshium protocol. Glyphs are visual anchors for conceptual primitives.

### **Manifesto**
The foundational document describing the vision, mission, and philosophical commitment of the Satoshium project.

### **Protocol**
The set of cryptographic, procedural, and coordination rules that define how agents interact in the system. Satoshium is governed by protocolâ€”not command.

### **Quorum**
A defined set of agents required to reach consensus before a privileged operation can be performed.

### **Sandboxed Agent**
An agent operating with limited permissions and contained logic, unable to write or execute beyond its scope unless explicitly authorized.

### **Scenario**
A modular, reproducible situation designed to test or simulate agent behavior in real or hypothetical contexts.

### **Self-Certifying**
A process or module capable of verifying its own integrity through cryptographic proof, without external validation.

### **ZK-Proof**
A zero-knowledge proof, used to validate a claim or compliance without exposing raw data.

## ðŸ§  Terminology Philosophy

Satoshium embraces the precision of language as a matter of protocol integrity. Words must mean something specificâ€”and that meaning must propagate across code, documentation, and interaction.

Every term listed here is audited and linked to the greater architecture of the project.
