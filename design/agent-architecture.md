📌 Title:
Satoshium Agent Architecture

⚙️ Overview
Satoshium agents are autonomous, cryptographically-governed entities operating under verifiable rules — not mutable commands. Each agent performs specialized roles within the decentralized intelligence layer, communicating, enforcing, and executing with embedded logic.

Agents operate on a governed execution lifecycle, validated through Bitcoin-aligned timestamping, constraints, and policy boundaries.

🧩 Core Roles
Role	Function
Executor	Performs tasks based on policy and cryptographic inputs. Has bounded permissions and cannot operate outside its assigned scope.
Guard	Validates agent actions. Rejects tasks that violate rules or constraints. Enforces permissioning and logic boundaries.
Messenger	Handles inter-agent communication. Ensures encrypted, authenticated, and timestamped messaging between agents and systems.
Governance Agent	Enforces policy changes, triggers lifecycle updates, and interfaces with external systems (e.g., multisig approvals, DAO-like structures).

Lifecycle Phases:
Initialization: Agent instance is generated and assigned a role.

Verification: The Guard checks inputs, scope, and timing validity.

Authorization: Multi-signature or quorum check (optional depending on tier).

Execution: The Executor agent performs a bounded action.

Archival: Messenger logs outcome, timestamped on-chain or in shared ledger.

🛡️ Governance and Constraints
Cryptographic Policies: Every agent executes actions tied to verifiable rules.

No Human Override: Human actors cannot issue mutable commands to live agents.

Rate Limits & Boundaries: Agents have pre-defined time, scope, and data boundaries.

Accountability Layer: All outputs are signed, logged, and externally auditable.

🔁 Inter-Agent Communication
All messages passed via Messenger agents must be:

Encrypted (using public-key infra or equivalent)

Signed and timestamped

Stored in verifiable logs or mirrored to tamper-proof locations (e.g., IPFS, BTC timestamping)

🧱 Sample Use Case (Illustrative)
A user submits a query to an AI tool.
The Executor proposes a solution.
The Guard validates that no sensitive or policy-breaking data is touched.
The Messenger transmits the approved output to the user.
If the agent oversteps its boundary, the Governance Agent intervenes to freeze it.

🛠️ Future Extensions
Plug into Bitcoin L2 timestamping (Stacks, Ordinals, OpenTimestamps)

ZK validation for sensitive interactions

DAO or quorum governance for agents that evolve over time
