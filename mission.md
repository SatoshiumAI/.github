🌍 Satoshium Mission

At Satoshium, we believe intelligence should follow protocol — not politics, profits, or power.

Our mission is to build a decentralized intelligence infrastructure governed by Bitcoin, where agents act based on cryptographic truth instead of centralized commands.

We are committed to:

⦁	🛡️ Reinforcing digital sovereignty through permissionless logic

⦁	📜 Creating verifiable, tamper-proof systems for AI and automation

⦁	🤝 Empowering global builders with open tools and transparent processes

⦁	🔁 Iterating publicly, ethically, and accountably

Satoshium is a protocol-first project — not a product. Not a brand. Not a walled garden.

We invite developers, researchers, and idealists to help us push back against the black box era — and forge a new foundation for intelligence, one verifiable step at a time.

Governed by Bitcoin. Guided by builders. Verified by code.
