# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This document outlines the high-level structure and key architectural decisions that shape the Satoshium ecosystem. It serves as a source of truth for contributors seeking to understand how the protocol is structured, how its components interact, and why certain design principles were chosen.

---

## üß† Guiding Principles

Satoshium is designed around the following principles:

- **Decentralization by Default**: All modules prioritize decentralization of control and information.
- **Agent Transparency**: Every agent operates according to auditable rules.
- **Governance by Protocol**: Human discretion is minimized in favor of pre-agreed logic.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Truth is determined through verifiable computation and anchored cryptographic evidence.
- **Layered Design**: Each layer builds on a lower-level primitive with minimal coupling.

## üß© Component Overview

Satoshium is built as a modular system composed of the following primary components:

- **Agents Layer (`/agents`)**: AI entities that interpret, execute, and validate protocol-compliant actions.
- **Core Layer (`/core`)**: Includes schemas, constants, base rulesets, and foundational utilities.
- **Interface Layer (`/interface`)**: Provides user-facing access to the protocol through human-readable dashboards, queries, and logs.
- **Data Layer (`/data`)**: Hosts structured knowledge graphs, registries, datasets, and vocabularies.
- **Specs Layer (`/specs`)**: Defines standards, agent roles, lifecycle logic, and protocol behavior specifications.
- **Utils Layer (`/utils`)**: Contains reusable libraries for encryption, messaging, simulation, and more.
- **Governance Layer (`/governance`)**: Manages policy, rules, contributor access, and protocol upgrades.

## üîÄ Data Flow

1. **Input** is submitted through the interface (UI, CLI, or API).
2. **Validation** is performed by one or more agents based on protocol rules.
3. **Execution** is delegated to internal or external modules (agents, scripts, services).
4. **Audit Trail** is generated and stored in `/logs/`, optionally using ZK-proofs or hashes.
5. **Outputs** are routed to users, dashboards, or other agents.

## üß¨ Agent Execution Model

Each agent follows a standardized lifecycle:

```text
OBSERVE ‚Üí INTERPRET ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí ACT ‚Üí LOG
```

Agent coordination is governed through protocol triggers, timers, and consensus interactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Topology

- **Monorepo Compatibility**: Repos are modular, but can be cloned individually or as part of a monorepo build system.
- **Composable Architecture**: Components can be reused in simulations, production environments, and audits.
- **Deterministic Output**: Execution across environments yields reproducible and hash-verifiable results.

## üß± Dependencies

| Layer       | Key Dependencies                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Agents      | Core, Specs, Utils                    |
| Core        | N/A                                    |
| Interface   | Core, Data, Agents                    |
| Data        | Specs                                 |
| Specs       | Core, Governance                      |
| Utils       | N/A                                    |
| Governance  | Core, Data, Contributors              |

## üß≠ Evolution Path

Satoshium‚Äôs architecture is expected to evolve through the following phases:

1. **Foundation Setup** (complete): Directory standardization, CODEX audit framework, contributor bootstrapping
2. **Agent Development**: Functional agents with test coverage and predictable behavior
3. **Protocol Layering**: Adding formal lifecycle constraints, triggers, and compliance
4. **Autonomous Governance**: Gradual transition to self-enforcing policy models
5. **External Network Integration**: Collaboration with external DAOs, L2s, and trusted compute environments
