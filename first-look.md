# 👁️‍🗨️ First Look — Satoshium GitHub

Welcome to the GitHub organization for **Satoshium** — a decentralized protocol for intelligence, coordination, and autonomy, rooted in Bitcoin.

If you're seeing this page, you're probably wondering:  
“What is Satoshium, and how do I get involved?”

## 🧠 What Is Satoshium?

Satoshium is a protocol where:

- Agents follow signed policy, not orders
- Messages are verifiable, not assumed
- Logic replaces authority

We don’t build apps. We build the **rules beneath them**.
