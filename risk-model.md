# 🛡️ Satoshium Risk Model

This document outlines the primary risk domains facing the Satoshium project and the mitigation strategies in place to ensure system integrity, resilience, and trustworthiness.

---

## 🔍 Risk Categories

Each category represents a potential threat vector that could undermine the Satoshium ecosystem if left unaddressed:

- **⚖️ Governance Capture**  
  Influence or control by a small set of actors undermining decentralized governance.

- **🕵️ Agent Misbehavior or Hijack**  
  Internal agents acting against protocol or being externally compromised.

- **📤 Data Leaks**  
  Unintended disclosure of sensitive user, agent, or network data.

- **⛔ Downtime or Denial of Service (DoS)**  
  Interruptions or targeted attacks that reduce availability or trust.

---

## 🧰 Mitigation Strategies

To protect against the above categories, Satoshium applies the following countermeasures:

- **🧱 Defense-in-Depth Architecture**  
  Layered safeguards from infrastructure to protocol logic.

- **🔎 Public Audits and Reviews**  
  Transparent reviews of agent behavior, code, and governance structures.

- **🔐 Agent Key Revocation & Rotation**  
  Robust cryptographic practices including immediate revocation of compromised keys.

By anticipating adversarial scenarios and building with resilience in mind, Satoshium is designed to defend against both internal failure and external threats—without sacrificing decentralization or transparency.
