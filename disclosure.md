# 🛡️ Satoshium — Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Satoshium is an experimental protocol exploring decentralized intelligence, messaging, and coordination. Security is fundamental to its design — and transparency is key to improving it.

We encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities, bugs, or weaknesses that could compromise agent behavior, relay integrity, or protocol assumptions.

## 🕵️ How to Report a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it discreetly by email:

📩 **contact@satoshium.ai**

Include as much detail as possible:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact or scope (if known)
- Any suggested mitigations

We prefer plain text or encrypted messages (PGP key to be published later).

---

## 🔒 Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a patch or mitigation is available
- Do not use the vulnerability for exploitation, access, or data retrieval
- Give us a reasonable window to investigate and respond (typically 7–30 days)

---

## 🧭 Scope

This policy applies to:

- Repositories under the `SatoshiumAI` GitHub organization
- Agent communication protocols
- Peer coordination, relay, or simulation logic

---

## 🫡 Recognition

While we don’t run formal bug bounty programs, we value and acknowledge responsible disclosures. Recognition (named or anonymous) may appear in `RECOGNITION.md`.

> We believe verifiability starts with humility — and systems are only as strong as their weakest assumption.
